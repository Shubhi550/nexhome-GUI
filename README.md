## What is a GUI?
GUI stands for graphical user interface. A GUI is exactly what it sounds like - **a graphical way to do stuff**. A graphical user interface is a way to communicate with a computer application (or computer operating system) using graphical symbols rather than typing the instructions in. GUIs let you work with picture-like items (icons and arrows for example) to tell the computer what you want from it. 

## What is a Smart Home?
Smart home is a term that refers to modern homes that have appliances, lighting and/or electronic devices that can be controlled remotely by the owner, often via a mobile app. Smart home-enabled devices can also operate in conjunction with other devices in the home and communicate information to other smart devices.

Smart home-enabled devices can include appliances like refrigerators, washing machines, dryers, and toaster ovens, as well as heating and air conditioning units and lighting devices. Some examples of smart home-enabled electronic devices are audio and video entertainment systems, camera and security systems, and computers, laptops and other electronics mobile devices.
